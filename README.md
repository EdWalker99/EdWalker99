### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# About Me:

I have recently graduated Hyperion Dev's **first government funded Bootcamp** studying Data Science, finishing 4th out of 250 students and acheiving an overall score of 100%.

As part of this bootcamp I have completed 53 projects, including 7 capstone projects which have taken me all the way from understanding the basics of popular programming languages such as Python to complicated supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques. These techniques include but are not limited to; 
- Simple and Multiple Linear Regression Models
- Logistic Regression Models
- Decision Trees
- Image Processing
- K-means and Hierarchical Clustering
- PCA

During the course of this bootcamp I have also learnt about the different database management systems and have had practice using SQLite to create a simple database that simulates a bookstores online stock records. 

I am currently open to work and can be contacted on my LinkedIn which is linked below.
